# IMT-S6-Paper-lens

PaperLens is a physical Toolglass using a sheet of paper. You hold and move the paper above a tabletop screen. The paper then acts as a Magic Lens, revealing data based on its distance in 3D space to the screen. For example, a PaperLens can be used to zoom or show layers of information. (source : https://hci-museum.lisn.upsaclay.fr/paperlens).

A fully digital representation of the PaperLens is proposed here : the tabletop screen is replaced by a browser window, and the paper by a popup window (or multiple ones) that acts as a magic lens.
